This program is intended to use the arduino as a flight controller for a quad copter.

It gets input from the BerryIMU V2, and a Futaba T6EX to control a quad copter.
Currently it has self leveling features programmed and that's it.
Everything is untested with a real quad copter and it's likely that it will immediately 
crash if you try to use it as a flight controller. That being said this program will continue to be updated often
and eventually it will get real-world testing.
