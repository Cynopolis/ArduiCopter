-Impliment PID Loops for pitch, roll, and yaw. - Needs testing??
-Translate PID outputs to ESC inputs - Needs testing
-Add kalman filters to the PID loop. Xangle + GyroX, Yangle + GyroY, heading + GyroZ
-Impliment input from the RC reciever
-Add failsafe
-Tune PID loops

At this point the Quad Copter should be flyable, and the rest is gravy

Now I want a way for the quad to easily hold its altitude
-Impliment an altitude PID loop.
-Add kalman filter to altitude PID loop
-Tune altitude PID loop

Now I want the arduino to be able to do GPS tracking
-Impliment GPS communicaiton with the berry IMU
-Add a position hold function the quad
-Add GPS data to kalman filter?

Now I want telemetry to be sent between the arduino and a computer
-Impliment radio communication over a frequency that's not 5.8 or 2.5 GHz
-Make the communication method reliable (call and response)
-Allow the arduino to take commands over telemetry
